## Download
Download your own copy of the Flow Chart [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wAUsTIeKRgSfo0m-3rR4P6Boi3FuixEk/view).

## Summary
This Flow Chart was originally uploaded to stackoverflow in .PNG format [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/471432/in-which-scenario-do-i-use-a-particular-stl-container/22671607#22671607). Since no editable version of the Flow Chart existed, I created one so that programmers, learning about data structures and algorithms, like myself, could create their own variations with ease.

## Contributions
Any implementations of non-existing paths or alternative / new data structures are highly appreciated! Also, improvements to pre-existing paths and data structures are highly welcome!

### Steps to contribute to this project
1. Download your own copy of the Editable Flow Chart .xml file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wAUsTIeKRgSfo0m-3rR4P6Boi3FuixEk/view?usp=sharing).
2. Go to [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) and open the flow chart .xml file you just downloaded in step 1 with:

    `File > Open from > Device`.
3. Modify the flow chart however you'd like.
4. Export your modified flow chart with: 

    `File > Export as > XML > Select only "Compressed" and "All Pages" > Export > Device`
